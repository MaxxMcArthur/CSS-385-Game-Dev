The game that I honestly spend too much time playing is Block Blast. It is a game that I have found can calm me down when I am stressed and help me “turn off my brain” for a little while I am playing it. This game is a really fun game to me and I am drawing my inspiration from this game because I want to build a similar game but different. The game has somewhat of an algorithm to it. I want to change the game to practice with those subsetted algorithms. To me it would feel like more of a challenge and require a little more thought to play the game, which I would prefer.
