I would keep a lot of the things the same as block blast. I would just change three major things: the goal, the progression, and the gameplay. I would keep the game board the same and the pieces the same and the game mechanics the same. First off , I would change the goal from an endless mode where you try to obtain as many points as possible to clearing the board and using all the pieces provided. Secondly, I would change the progression from an endless level where you try to get a high score to levels you can complete and move to the next level. Lastly, the gameplay I would provide the user with a board with a certain amount of blocks on it(sometimes none) and a “hand”(no specified amount changes per level) of blocks that they are supposed to use to complete the goal of each level that I talked about before.
